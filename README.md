Project for looking at how people use Julia.

# TODO

Roughly sorted in order of priority

* [ ] Better plot, maybe interactive
* [ ] Get queries working, maybe rethink?
* [ ] Get git info (mostly `blame`) out of files.
* [ ] Tests!
* [ ] Figure out `ComputeFramework.reduce`
* [ ] standardize indentation. Can I change this for `jupyter`?

# Issues

* JuliaParser doesn't seem to allow for reading starting from wherever
  * I tried to fix it, but am getting a weird error
